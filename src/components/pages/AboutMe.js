I was born and raised in Karditsa, a small town at the center of Greece. In 2010 I left my home town due to my military services. My journey as a photographer started in 2015 when I decided to buy a camera to express my thoughts and concerns. At first it was terribly difficult to obtain the knowledge about photography but as time passed, I was getting more and more used to it. After a short time I found myself playing and not using my camera as a tool of creativity. Then I met my teacher Evangelos Tamvakos, founder of Instantane Photography School, who embraced my concerns and passion about photography.
  Concerning photography, I am passionate at capturing the nature by all means. 
  So, I introduce you to my work. Happiness comes when someone finds himself and some pieces of his life, inside the photographerâ€™s approach.
  I bid you welcome to my site and enjoy yourselves!
